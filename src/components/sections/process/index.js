        <p>
          I believe in a considered approach to design, and I try to be
          methodical üß™ while I'm being creative üé®. The designer's method isn't
          all that different from the scientific method really; we theorise,
          hypothesise, test, invariably have to revisit our theories, and get
          closer and closer to a solution. The solution can mean compromise.
          Compromise on time, efficiencies, or future proofing. Ultimately it's
          about making the decision that feels right, at the right time ‚ù§Ô∏è.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we have a solution in place to a problem ‚úÖ it all starts over
          again with another one, or maybe an expansion on something previously
          considered. Each of these small pieces fit together in the puzzle üß©
          to form the product with each feature having a purpose, but none able
          to stand alone without a clear image of the product and a solid
          foundation. Complex products and interactions are what make me tick ‚åö
          and digging into, and attempting to solve, these problems is where I
          am happiest.
