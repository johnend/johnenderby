        <p>
          FanDuel spends a lot of money on third party engineering teams, and as
          part of the focus in 2020 the company wanted to bring as much of that
          expertise in house as possible. One of the areas where we relied
          heavily on third parties was our free to play games üé≤. When the new
          vertical was spun up I jumped at the chance to work on a project like
          this. Having designed big systems before (ACE360) I wanted to get
          stuck into solving complex problems again and building our own
          internal free to play game generation platform is certainly something
          to get your teeth ü¶∑ stuck into.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a number of complexities to build into the system (games that run
          as one offs, across multiple days, or with different interaction
          types) there is a lot to account for, and a lot to do üèóÔ∏è. We're
          building our MVP right now, so I can't go into too much detail here.
          Suffice to say the MVP will be a big change for free to play games at
          FanDuel, shortening the time to develop new games and ideas, and
          giving company some space to reinvest the money we spend on third
          parties üí∏.
