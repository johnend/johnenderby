          I believe in a considered approach to design, and I try to be

          . The designer's method isn't all that different from the scientific
          method really; we theorise, hypothesise, test, invariably have to
          revisit our theories, and get closer and closer to a solution. In
          order to get to a solution there often needs to be a fair amount of
          compromise. Compromise on time, efficiencies, or future proofing.
          Ultimately it's about making the decision that feels right, at the
          right time{" "}

          it all starts over again with another one, or maybe an expansion on
          something previously considered. Each of these small pieces fit
          together in the puzzle{" "}

          to form the product with each feature having a purpose, but none able
          to stand alone without a clear image of the product and a solid
          foundation. Complex products and interactions are what make me tick{" "}
