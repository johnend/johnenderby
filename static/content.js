          "A full application and payment procedure for assessors to become accredited with the guild.",
        why:
          "Prior to deregulation in 2017 FISSS were the only monitor of apprenticeships within England and Wales. After deregulation FISSS found themselves in a position to not only capitalise on their management of apprenticeships, but also the accreditation of assessors.",

        firstPara:
          "ACE360 was a large project requiring a lot of investigation into specifics of: constraints, workflows, permissions, and much more. For example, there are at least 3 different organisation types needing access to the system, and between them 14 different user levels with different access permissions.",
        secondTitle: "Extracting the detail through collaboration",
        secondPara:
          "As a result of the complexities I worked with FISSS to run a number of workshops to get a better understanding of the information architecture, and workflows, within ACE360. The output of these sessions was a number of large scale journey maps and flow diagrams (something not previously done at xDesign prior to my working there) that helped me and the team understand this incredibly complex space, as well as breakdowns of epics and tickets for working with engineering (part of phase 2 product ownership).",

        firstTitle: "Ideate & Prototype",
        firstPara:
          "In order to start getting deeper into the design of the system we ran further collaborative workshops with the client, and their customers, fleshing out wireframes for screens and journeys and validating those ideas conceptually. ",
        secondTitle: "Adding the visual layers",
        secondPara:
          "ACE360 had, prior to working with us, been through a branding workshop with a third party that had created a visual styleguide for them. This included fonts and colours, but not their application to an interface. During the visual design stages I put together a component library and design system for the product, as well as designing all the screens and flows.",

      test: {
        firstTitle: "Test & Refine",
        firstPara:
          "After working out the basic flows I created at least 5 prototypes for various journeys within the system for different organisations, and users with different levels of permissions within them. These prototypes were used to validate the journeys and help me gather feedback on where we could improve certain areas.",
        secondTitle: "An eye opening waterfall",
        secondPara:
          "ACE360 was a big turning point for xDesign. The client was very much wanting a waterfall process in the beginning, leading to a huge amounts of work being done up front. After the initial phase (roughly 6 months), and after I took over as product owner we moved to a more agile process working in two weekly sprints and factoring in feedback over the course of the project.",

      deliver: {
        firstTitle: "Deliver",
        firstPara:
          "During the delivery phases of ACE360 I determined that the handoff process for the team was more difficult than it should have been. Inspecting layers in Sketch was poor at the time and packing up assets for export was time consuming for designers, and engineers. I updated our workflow to include a better handoff tool - Sympli, allowing engineers in all departments (web and native) to inspect designs directly and pull in assets in the format they needed without design involvement.",
        secondTitle: "Working with engineers",
        secondPara:
          "In my capacity as product owner on phase 2 of ACE360 (lasting roughly 12 months) I was responsible for classifying and breaking down epics with the team and the client, working with engineering to define acceptance criteria and assign estimates, and ensuring we were delivering the client‚Äôs roadmap as closely as possible.",

        outroTitle: "Learn",
        outroPara:
          "ACE360 was one of those projects that was always going to be a challenge, and came with a lot of constraints from all sides. Would I have done things differently? Absolutely. Were the decisions to do things differently down to me to make? No. In hindsight the first six months of work (waterfall phase) likely resulted in decisions being made that the team, and I, needed to revert or adjust during the second phase.",
